  abstract     = {Reproducibility is a highly desired feature of scientific investigation in general, and it has special connotations for research in pharmacokinetics, a vibrant field with over 500,000 publications to-date. It is important to be able to differentiate between genuine heterogeneity in pharmacokinetic parameters from heterogeneity that is due to errors and biases. This overview discusses efforts and opportunities to diminish the latter type of undesirable heterogeneity. Several reporting and research guidance documents and standards have been proposed for pharmacokinetic studies, but their adoption is still rather limited. Quality problems in the methods used and model evaluations have been examined in some empirical studies of the literature. Standardization of statistical and laboratory tools and procedures can be improved in the field. Only a small fraction of pharmacokinetic studies become pre-registered and only 9995 such studies have been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov as of August 2018. It is likely that most pharmacokinetic studies remain unpublished. Publication bias affecting the results and inferences has been documented in case studies, but its exact extent is unknown for the field at-large. The use of meta-analyses in the field is still limited. Availability of raw data, detailed protocols, software and codes is hopefully improving with multiple ongoing initiatives. Several research practices can contribute to greater transparency and reproducibility for pharmacokinetic investigations.},

A diverse set of stakeholders-representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers-have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community. },

Fasting plasma caffeine concentrations were significantly higher in cirrhotics (11.1 +/- 10.5 mumol/l) than in healthy volunteers (1.5 +/- 0.8 mumol/l). The respective values measured in patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease (3.1 +/- 3.1 mumol/l) did not differ significantly from the controls. Plasma disappearance rate and clearance of caffeine were significantly decreased in cirrhotics (0.11 +/- 0.02 h-1; 1.0 +/- 0.3 ml/min per kg) and in patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease (0.18 +/- 0.04 h-1; 2.2 +/- 0.7 ml/min per kg) as compared to healthy volunteers (0.23 +/- 0.04 h-1; 3.1 +/- 0.9 ml/min per kg). Plasma caffeine concentration determined 12 h after administration of the test dosage discriminated best between patients with cirrhosis (5.4 +/- 1.6 mumol/l), patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease (2.0 +/- 1.4 mumol/l) and healthy volunteers (0.8 +/- 0.2 mumol/l). These results, the safety of the test compound and the simplicity of a single caffeine determination in plasma 12 h after a standardized dose of caffeine make this test attractive for evaluation of liver function.},

  abstract        = {Six healthy volunteers received a single caffeine dose after pretreatment with norfloxacin, pipemidic acid, or placebo in a crossover, randomized, single-blind clinical trial. Quinolones altered the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, with a significant increase in the AUCs and a decrease in plasma clearance. The elimination half-life increased significantly with pipemidic acid. The apparent volume of distribution, mean renal clearance, and time to reach maximum caffeine concentrations remained unaltered. There was a decline in caffeine metabolite levels in the 24-hour urine samples for both quinolone treatments, suggesting that pipemidic acid and, to a lesser degree, norfloxacin inhibit metabolism of the N-demethylation pathways of caffeine. The practical consequence of this observation could be caffeine accumulation during repeated intake of coffee. In two additional healthy volunteers under a controlled multiple-dose regimen of caffeine ingestion, administration of pipemidic acid for 2 days caused a fourfold increase in the plasma concentrations of caffeine.},

  abstract        = {Caffeine has been shown to maintain or improve the performance of individuals, but its pharmacokinetic profile for Asians has not been well characterized. In this study, a population pharmacokinetic model for describing the pharmacokinetics of caffeine in Singapore males was developed. The data were also analysed using non-compartmental models. Data gathered from 59 male volunteers, who each ingested a single caffeine capsule in two clinical trials (3 or 5 mg/kg), were analysed via non-linear mixed-effects modelling. The participants' covariates, including age, body weight, and regularity of caffeinated-beverage consumption or smoking, were analysed in a stepwise fashion to identify their potential influence on caffeine pharmacokinetics. The final pharmacostatistical model was then subjected to stochastic simulation to predict the plasma concentrations of caffeine after oral (204, 340 and 476 mg) dosing regimens (repeated dosing every 6, 8 or 12 h) over a hypothetical 3-day period. The data were best described by a one-compartmental model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination. Smoking status was an influential covariate for clearance: clearance (mL/min) = 110*SMOKE + 114, where SMOKE was 0 and 1 for the non-smoker and the smoker respectively. Interoccasion variability was smaller compared to interindividual variability in clearance, volume and absorption rate (27% vs. 33%, 10% vs. 15% and 23% vs. 51% respectively). The extrapolated elimination half-lives of caffeine in the non-smokers and the smokers were 4.3 +/- 1.5 and 3.0 +/- 0.7 h respectively. Dosing simulations indicated that dosing regimens of 340 mg (repeated every 8 h) and 476 mg (repeated every 6 h) should achieve population-averaged caffeine concentrations within the reported beneficial range (4.5-9 microg/mL) in the non-smokers and the smokers respectively over 72 h. The population pharmacokinetic model satisfactorily described the disposition and variability of caffeine in the data. Mixed-effects modelling showed that the dose of caffeine depended on cigarette smoking status.},

A correct estimation of the relative magnitudes of intra-individual and inter-individual variations in caffeine elimination is significant for the use of the elimination parameter of caffeine to characterize the biotransformation capacity of a specific form of cytochrome P-450 (1AII) in vivo. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the magnitudes of fluctuation of caffeine-clearance and half-life as well as inter- and intra-individual comparison in 12 healthy male subjects. Compared to the high reproducibility of caffeine decay curves in each healthy male, caffeine elimination varied more extensively between subjects. The distribution of variance amounted to: intra-individual 21.4%, inter-individual 78.6%. The knowledge of variance provided precise evidence of the sample size, which is necessary to prove previously defined differences.},
